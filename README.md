*Project Description*

<img src="https://github.com/DimaDoesCode/Yandex_Practicum-Composite_Project-2/blob/master/gold_recovery.png" width="200" height="200" align="left"/>

Prepare a prototype of a machine learning model for "Zyfra". The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises.
The model should predict the gold recovery coefficient from gold-bearing ore. You have access to data with mining and purification parameters.
The model will help optimize production to avoid launching a facility with unprofitable characteristics.
You need to:<br>
◦ Prepare the data.<br>
◦ Conduct exploratory data analysis.<br>
◦ Build and train the model.
